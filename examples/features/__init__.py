Contents:

- basic_type_safety.py (Shows how `evrmore-rpc` uses type hints to guide development, enable static checking, and improve editor support)
- complete_rpc_coverage.py (Shows how to verify full RPC method coverage against the Evrmore node)
- connection_pooling.py (Shows how the EvrmoreClient reuses its internal connection/session to avoid the overhead of creating a new connection per request)
- contextuality.py (Shows how the EvrmoreClient can be used in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts)
- flexible_config.py (Shows how the EvrmoreClient can be configured in various ways, including from `evrmore.conf`, environment variables, and manual parameters)
